				<h4>Summary</h4>
				<p>Aaron Swartz technical legacy is questionable, however, the political and social legacy is far reaching. His vision for an internet where ideas and content are of the hightest value, in my opinion, is what a number of compainies and platforms are losing sight of.</p>
				<h4>Today's Environment</h4>
				<p>The Terms echo chamber, and, fake news, dominate cyber space and the media. As social meadia and large companies come to define how we interact with content. For the modern developer an understanding how our work shapes a highly reactive political environment is, something we should think about.
				<p>In the late early 2000s the news was dominated by stories of mothers been taken to court for millions of dollars for music downloaded by their children. While at the same time groups like the Arctic Monkies and Halvin Harris connected with their audience by releasing music for free.</p>
				<p>Today new laws like Article 13 threaten internet freedom, GDPR is a mystery to the industry it claims to police and the FCC's net neutrality threatens small start ups with a pay to post data model.</p>
				<p>Aricle 13 certainly threatens artist rise to fame as algorithms search DSN services and ISPs for data pattens linked to music catalogues. GDPR threatans small start ups, as to put it simply no one truely understands the application, and very few cases have been ruled on at this time.</p>
				<h4>Legacy</h4> 
				<p>The leadership Swartz displayed in the fight against SOPA, PIPA and CIPSA, has become lost to the back pages of Reddit, the very site Swartz helped turn into a social media power house, with his understanding of how internet communities are shaped and interact. In his paper "Who writes Wikipedia?" he showed there was a rich community who added most of, while, a small group of wikipedians maintain style and form for consistency.</p>
				<p>
					Who are the moderators of todays internet? Is it going to be a group of people who format badly worded description or faceless algorithms who simply stop the badly worded sentences from making it on to the page in the first place?

					<blockquote title="The boy who could change the world <br> the writings of Aaron Swartz" cite="Aaron Swartz weblog">"Transparency can be a powerful thing, but not in isolation. So, let's stop passing the buck by saying our job is just to get the data out there and it's other people's job to figure out how to use it. Let's decide that our job is to fight for good in the world. I'd love to see all these amazing resources go to work on that." Aaron Swartz</blockquote> 
				<p>This quote comes over as idiolistic. I like to think it means members of the tech community have a duty to ensure they're not creating caves and voids for echo chambers to exist in. I'll leave you to judge his legacy and place in the history of the internet.</p>
