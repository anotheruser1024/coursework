				<h3>Aaron Swartz Legacy</h3>
				<h4>Summary</h4>
				<p>In his life time Aaron Swartz technical legacy is questionable. However, the political and social lagacy is huge. His vision for an internet where ideas and content are of the hightest value, in my opinion, is what a number of compainies and platforms are losing sight of.</p>
				<h4>Today's Enviroment</h4>
				<p>The Terms eacho chamber, and, fake news, dominate cyber space and the media. As social meadia and large companies come to define how we interact with content. For the modern developer an understanding how our work shapes and is viewed by a highly reactive political enviorment is, well, something we'll think about later.Should this be the case?
				<p>In the late early 2000s the news was dominated by stories of mothers been taken to court for millions of dollers for music downloaded by thier children. While at the same time groups like the Arctic Monkies and Halvin Harris connected with thier audance by releasing music for free.</p><p>Today new laws like Artical 13 threaten internet freedom, GDPR is a mystory to the industry it claims to police and the FCC's net nutrality threatanse small start ups with a pay to post data modle.</p>
				<p>Arical 13 may certianly threaten bands rise to fame as Algorithums search DSN services and ISPs for data pattens linked to music catalouges. GDPR threatans small start ups, as to put it simply no one truely understands the law, and very few cases have been ruled on at this time.</p>
				<h4>legacy</h4> 
				<p>The leadership Swartz displaded in the fight against SOPA, PIPA and CIPSA, has become lost to the back pages of reddit, the very site Swartz helped turn into a social media power house. With his understanging of how internet comunities are shaped and interact been key to this. In his paper "Who writes Wikipedia?" he showed there was a rich comunity who added most of the while, while a small group of wikipedians maintained style and form for consisancy</p>
				<p>
					who are the moderators of todays internet? is going to be agroup of people who format badly worded decriptions or faceless algorithums who simply stop the badly worded sentance from making it on to the page in the first place?

					<blockquote id="lagacyquote">"Transparency can be a powerful thing, but not in isolation. So, let's stop passing the buck by saying our job is just to get the data out there and it's other people's job to figure out how to use it. Let's decide that our job is to fight for good in the world. I'd love to see all these amazing resources go to work on that."</blockquote> 
				<p>This quote comes over as idiolistic and vague, I like to think it means members of the tech community have a duty to ensure they're not creating caves and voids for echo chambers to exist in. I leave you to judge his legacy and place in the history of the internet</p>
					<blockquote>"Iformation is power. But like all power, there are those who want to keep it for themselves.</blockquote>
